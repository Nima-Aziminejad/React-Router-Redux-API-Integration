# React App with React Router, Redux, and RESTful API Integration

Welcome to the `React App with React Router, Redux, and RESTful API Integration` repository! This project showcases the development of a dynamic React application that leverages React Router and Redux for effective navigation, state management, and user authentication. The application implements protected routes, ensures user authorization, and effectively interacts with a server through RESTful APIs.

## Features

- React Router Navigation: Create a smooth and intuitive navigation experience using React Router, allowing users to seamlessly transition between different parts of the application.

- Redux State Management: Utilize Redux to centrally manage the application's state, ensuring efficient sharing of data across components and enabling streamlined updates.

- Protected Authenticated Routes: Implement protected routes to ensure that only authorized users can access certain sections of the application, enhancing security and user experience.

- RESTful API Interaction: Develop a structured API interaction mechanism to communicate with the server using RESTful principles, enabling efficient data exchange.

- User Information and Token Management: Store user information securely using file storage, and manage authentication tokens for seamless user experience across sessions.

## Usage
### React Router
Define routes and components using React Router in the src/routes directory to create a navigational structure.

### Redux State Management
Implement Redux state management in the src/redux directory to centralize and manage application-wide state.

### Protected Routes
Secure routes in the src/routes directory to ensure that only authorized users can access specific components and views.

### RESTful API Interaction
Utilize the api.js file in the src/services directory to interact with the server using RESTful API calls.

### Token and User Storage
Implement secure token storage and user information management using file storage in the src/utils directory.
